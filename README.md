# mls_practice_data
This is a collection of files I used to practice my SQL skills through SQLite in Python 3. MLS data mainly focusing on the 2020 season was taken from Kaggle and Football Reference and modified in Excel. I then uploaded the excel data into my Jupyter Notebook rather than simply reading the csv file in Python because my skills were still developing when this 'project' was created. I have greatly improved both my Python and SQL skills since then and will no longer be making edits to this repository. The purpose is to show my early steps with Python and SQLite, along with my interest in sports data analytics.
